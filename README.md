# TensorFlowTutorials
A repository of tutorials that I have completed for tensorflow. From the tensor flow documentation (github repository 'tensorflow/docs')

This repository is intended as a personal record.

# How to run these Tutorials

Either using tensorflow environment (e.g. using Anaconda)

Or (prefered) using google 'Colaboratory' environment (online environment in browser with access to gpu acceleration):

*To view these jupyter notebooks in colabortory*
- Open google colab: https://colab.research.google.com/
- Append the url to the jupyter notebook (e.g. https://colab.research.google.com/github/meisben/docs/blob/master/bmcCompletedTutorials/tutorials/keras/basic_classification.ipynb)
- Go edit -> notebook settings -> hardware acceleration -> select GPU
